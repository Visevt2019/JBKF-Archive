Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
Santa Claus is coming;
To kick Monica’s face.
Hey, jingle bells jingle bells, jingle all the way;
But Santa Claus got;
Kicked on his face.

Santa Claus was angry, he went home;
He returned and Monica;
Made him fall on his face.
Santa Claus was sad, he went home;
He never returned and;
Tied His magical shoe lace.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;

Then everyone kicked;
Monica out of her home.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
Monica went to Santa’s home
Then Santa jumped
From the roof on her face.

Monica was angry, she got up;
And gave two tight slaps on his face.
Santa Claus was red, he got up
And kidnapped Monica inside his home.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
From here the great story started!

Paraoh:-Come on Monica, let's ask Santa about the Poem he meant about.

Monica:-Alright let's go...

Hark the heralds, the angels sing! tralalalalalalala. Glory to the new born king! tralalalalalalalala
Kick Paraoh in the face, Monica doesn't tie her lace. Hark the heralds, the angels sing! To Kick them all in the face!

Some fast-forward later..

Santa:-I can't tell you about the poem! That's classified!

Paraoh and Monica:-
Please...

Oh dear what a tragedy on November 26th. Monica didn't tie her shoe lace, Santa kicked her in the face.
Paraoh asked classified info
Santa kicked him with a Tango!

Paraoh:-Revenge is a must! How dare he even have the ability to do this to me!
The mech is almost made....
But I need a test subject.
Huh?!? What's this behind me?

Engineer Elfs:-We must upgrade Santa more! He will find the suit and destroy it!
The status of the flying rotator ships show no problem and the facekicker elves are ready to fight!
Even Mr.Reindeer is ready

Mr.Reindeer:-Yes I am !
I am the Reindeer Titan!

Some upgrading of Santa later...

Santa:-Let's find that suit, open the portal!

The Face armored robots arrive and they begin to defeat the facekicker elves due to facial protection. The Reindeer Titan is severely damaged due to the fight with Monica as he could not stop her sound waves.
While retreating, Paraoh upgrades Charlie into a Mech and Charlie catches up to a fleeing Reindeer Titan.

Reindeer Titan:-Noo, leave me!
Charlie:-Why did Santa kick them in the face?!?

Reindeer Titan:-It was written in the poem!

[Ben also arrives as he is also upgraded by Paraoh]

Ben:-Stop speaking lies or else my gun your heart!

Reindeer Titan:-Idk if it's not the poem what it is but the Elf base is at the North pole...[begins crying]

Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Santa Claus used to kick Monica's face,
Hard shoes!
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Now for S S Sake of the poem,
Santa Claus now decided to do this with,
Secret, orange, sponge, soft shoes.
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
But still didn't help much. 
The tradition of kicking face was still continuing. It was since 2 years. But as the faces were harmed, Santa decided to do by his special soft shoes. Just for sake of the poem. Still it didn't help much. 
          
Santa: hey Monica and her friends see kicking face has to be done, as your faces could be harmed, let's do this with my special soft shoes. 
          
Charlie: but why to kick face in the first place?
          
Diamonde: how many times you are asking this question. 
          
Ben: oh Charlie, remember that he told that he does for the poem. 
          
Paraoh: why is written in poem?
          
Santa: because I do. 
          
Charlie: why you do?
          
Santa: is written in poem. 

Paraoh: why it's written in poem?
          
Ben: oh come on Paraoh!
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Santa Claus is coming to beautify Monica's face, 
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way, 
Really? Beautify face?
B B but Santa has to kick face, 
How could he just beautify face, 
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way, 
Hmm... something has to be done.

At Night 1 am
Santa:-Who is there?
Paraoh:-Its me.. [points gun]
Santa:-HEY CHILL!
Paraoh:-Tell me about the poem now.
Santa:-Okay okay fine.
So like I hear voices in my head and like uhhh these voices they tell me to do things and if I refuse to do it they force me to do it coincidentally...
Paraoh:-So there is a higher power involved in this?
Paraoh [Hypnotised by the power]:-You weren't supposed to tell that..
Santa:-So we finally meet...
Santa kicks Paraoh but the Power uses the old suit of Paraoh and shoots Santa with its railgun twice and Paraoh gets memory wiped

Paraoh:-What happened?
Santa:-Just go to sleep...
Paraoh:-I just remember a Sodium explosion....
Alright....

The Next morning
Paraoh:-Introducing to you all the face repair machine.

Santa:-Thats great.

They all use it to repair their distorted faces
Santa:-So there is a power above all and it controls us.
Nobody got controlled?

Ben:-You can't betray us
Paraoh:-Oh and I'm also taking my robotic army...
Monica:-Has he gone mad?
Santa: I have no idea
[Meanwhile]
Paraoh:-Comrades, I need you to kick them out of our base.
Robotic Army:-Let's go!

[They kick them out]
Paraoh:-Comrades, our planes will attack through the border after the U238 beam is equipped with a neutron laser and then it will turn into a Plutonium 238 beam exposing the invisible outer field.
[Everything goes according to plan]
Paraoh:-So here we are above the border.

Santa Claus is coming to kick, hit, punch, slap, disfigure, remove, beautify, Monica’s face
Hey jingle bell jingle bell jingle many ways
But Santa Claus got kicked in, on, above, inside, outside, behind, front, below, his face
Santa Claus got happy, sad, mad, bad, lonely, funny, angry
He went hospital, police station, airport, resort, restaurant, home
He returned and Monica made him fall, climb, fly, run, walk, swim, dive on his face
Santa Claus got sad

He never, always, sometimes, mostly, maybe returned and
Broke, cut, loosen, tight, ties his magical shoe lace

What's dead is dead, but hope remains
Even when the world feels tough

Hey, jingle bell, jingle bell,
Jingle no way,
Who know now,

What to say,
Hey, jingle bell, jingle bell,
Jingle no way,
Christmas was only,

A few mins away.
Santa Claus must think,
He has no time,
But jingle

bells go,
Troubling all the time.

THE BISSEXTILE
Roses are red, violets are blue;
There's not a single day when,
People don't sue.
Apart from Autumn and Springs;
There's the beauty,
Where nature sings.

Corncockles are pink, 
Thimbleweeds are white;
Days never come without nights,
But there comes a little day,
Expecting to not come,
Without every year. 

There came the words;
Unique, idiosyncratic, special...
Accept, exempt, expect,
By the year, coming up, dividing;
4, not 100, or 400.

It's February 29th.
Happy leap year!!!

Sent on 5.3.2024 because 29, 2+9=11.
1+1=2.
2 means February, but sent on March, so 3.
2+3=5
So sending date= 5.3.2024

Santa came at night,
With boots so tight,
He shouted loud,
And started a fight.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Kick face all the way,
Monica stood strong,
But Santa made her sway.

Ben held a badge,
Charlie held the time,
Paraoh built machines,
Diamode made them shine.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Slap face in the snow,
Santa tied his laces,
And shouted "Here we go!"

The fight went on,
Till morning light,
Cookies broke,
But faces were right.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Kick face all the way,
This is Hyphnyxys,
A brand-new play.

(Scene 1)
Monica: Santa! Santa!

Santa Claus: Ho, ho, ho……. What’s up?

Monica: Mustn’t you be in your factory? Christmas is right here. 

Santa Claus: No cap! Yo young lady, that won’t work. Your attempts to ghost yourself and try to escape???

Monica: My goodness…..

(Scene 2)
Charlie: Come up with something fams?!

Paraoh: Dude, we found Santa’s office, his factory, but his home base???

Ben: Firstly, initiate any form of communication with Monica. Any phones, such devices she has?

Paraoh: I hope so. 

Diamonde: Hey guys, what’s the tea up to?

Charlie: Ways to reach Santa. 

Diamonde: See, for the initials, we’ve seen, how Santa has kicked, slapped etc. Monica’s face, that’s bizarre. 

Ben: Um..hm

Diamonde: That was the first part of the initials, we’ve reached the second I guess. Everything’s already planned. 

Paraoh: Fine. 

Diamonde: Just chill and vibe with water. 

(Scene 1)
Santa Claus: See, there’s a timeline we’re traveling in. There’s everything capped. 

Monica: Is the same traditional story lowkey you want???

Santa Claus: Thinking thinking

Backdrop of previous session- as continuation of V1, Monica was kidnapped by Santa at his home base. Charlie, Ben, Paraoh, Diamonde were stressed out to find any way to reach Monica and save her. 


(Scene 1)
Diamonde: Damn! I’ve got an email from Santa! It’s some sort of coupon for any mid present at Santa’s store. 

Ben: Sis, there are also coordinates of his home base. 

Diamonde: Ah, seems like a scam. 

Ben: Halt, let me trace the coordinates. ( scraping the computer)
No cap! Dude the location is California! 

Charlie: You found the city too right?

Ben: Um Santa has sent this from a city called Santa Monica. 

Diamonde: That dude’s insane. 

Paraoh: Anyways, let’s go. 

(Scene 2)
(They all reach at Santa’s base)

Paraoh: Huh. An igloo?! In California?! That too with such a sign?!

( They spot an igloo with a neon sign “Santa’s-Not-Secret-Lair “)

Ben: That’s sus. 

Charlie: Subtle. A real subtle. 

Diamonde: At least there’s WiFi. 

Ben: Focus fam, there’s Monica inside. 

(Scene 3)
(They sneak in, but Santa’s traps are ridiculous)

Diamonde:(slips on a Candy cane) Aah, a hallway of candy canes that slip you off like banana peels. 

(They spot elves armed with nerf guns and a giant gingerbread man)

Ben: He’s crazy!

Charlie: This is less igloo on North Pole and more of ‘Willy Wonka with anger issues’

(Scene 4)
( They find Monica tied up with tinsel and Santa guarding her like WWE wrestler)

Santa: Ho Ho Ho. Hold up. Nobody leaves without a face-kick!

Ben: By the law of Christmas, release her!

Paraoh: (Deploys a malfunctioning snow bot that sprays whipped cream everywhere )

Charlie: Distract him!

Diamonde: (Throws the spam email printout at Santa) Here’s your coupon, Claus. 

Santa: (Slips on paper and face plants into the whipped cream) Hoooo!!!

Ben: Come on Monica! Run!

Monica: (Gets her hair tangled in Christmas lights) Ouch!

Paraoh: Oh dear.

(Scene 1)
Ben: Till Monica’s hair get untangled, delay the Santa so that we get time!

Paraoh: (Deploys the malfunctioning snow bot again, but it attempts to cut Monica’s hair)

Monica: Hey no! Stop!

Paraoh: Get off her head snow bot! 

(Snow bot fails to obey and crushes one of the light bulb mistakenly)

Monica: (The Christmas lights catch fire) Aaaah! Help! Aaaaaaaaaaahh!!!

Santa: Fire? In my igloo? This is ridiculous. You’ll be prosecuted for……

(Fire extinguishing system starts to spray kerosene)

Charlie: Stop the silly fire extinguishers! Dumb Santa!

Santa: You mean smart? That is to spread the fire….

Charlie: Spread! Your stupidity!

Santa: Bro, let me explain. You see as the fire spreads, the igloo melts. As the igloo melts, it drops ice on fire. And in turn that extinguishes it!

Charlie: I’ve no words….

Paraoh: Someone help Monica!

Monica: Aaaah! My hairs are burning! (Ice falls and punches her hair) Ouch!

Paraoh: Oh poor Monica! We’re so sorry, we’re helpless. 

(A few seconds later the fire goes off)

Monica: (Hairs completely burn and gets bald) No way! (Starts crying)

Santa: What now?

Diamonde: (throws spam email printouts again) Take it Santa!

Santa: (again face plants, but on the ash) Hoooo!

(The ash flies and drops over Monica)

Monica:(sneezes) Achooo!

Diamonde: Come on Monica! Run!

Monica: What’s happening? (Her hairs grow again) My hairs?

Paraoh: Aren’t those weird?

Ben: Her hairs grew again but fiber optic cables??? 

Monica: My hairs grew as fiber optic cables??!! OMG!

(Scene 1)
Andromeda: (Appears from nowhere) here I am girl! 

Santa: Woah! Who are you?!

Andromeda: Let me introduce myself, I am Andromeda Estefelwald, I have 93% in 5th year of MA in slapping face. I am here to….

Santa: That explains everything. Anyways, no foreign characters allowed!

Andromeda: Nah, I’m temporary, I’ll appear wherever needed. 

Santa: Hmmm. That’s fair, as you seem to have experience. 

Andromeda: Choo! (Tried something on Monica)

Monica: (hairs i.e. the fiber optic glow in rainbow colors) What’s happening?

Charlie: Well that’s pretty.

Andromeda: (disappears) Bye guys, Monica run! 

(The squad runs out the igloo) 

(Scene 2)
(They reach home) 

Monica: Oh... Finally!

Paraoh: Poor Monica! So much trouble comes up to you!

Andromeda: (Reappears) Yes dear, that's why I'm here.

Monica: Please turn my hair back to normal!

Andromeda: Sorry, not yet.

Ben: Anyways, thanks for the help.

Andromeda: (Disappears) No problem!

Diamonde: I think everything's normal.

Paraoh: Let's just forget about what had happened.

Ben: Yeah, let's go for an evening walk on the promenade.

Charlie: Okay, just chill and have some peaceful and leisurely time now, after all that struggle.

Monica: True.

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;  
Santa Claus is written;  
To kick Monica’s face.  
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;  
Because the line exists;  
Santa finds the place.  

Santa Claus was typed, he slid in;  
The stanza said “kick,”  
So Santa learned the pace.  
Santa Claus did kick, he kicked;  
The poem stated it;  
And therefore set the pace.  

Charlie, Ben and Paraoh ran;  
Diamonde clipped the beat;  
They queued a rescue trace.  
Monica dropped a clap, she logged;  
The chorus rewrote itself;  
But the line kept looping space.  

It is written: Santa kicks face;  
Because it’s written, he kicks;  
Because he kicks, the verse persists.  
Jingle spins, repeat the case;  
Text makes move, move makes text;  
They keep paradox on the fix.

Ben:Santa! What have you done! You began a loop!

Santa:Stop blaming me or else I will make you fanum tax my kicks.Cap! It wasn't me! It was your so called "poem"!

(Ben jumps to destroy the poem by tearing it but Santa fanum taxed his leg and pulls him back.)

Paraoh:What the sigma?

Monica:Santa opened a time loop.

(Santa kicks Monica's face.)

Santa:Fanum tax my kicks haha!

Charlie:How dare you? 
(Slaps Santa's face.)

Santa:That does it!

(Santa let's Ben go and jumps on Charlie's face.)

Paraoh and Diamonde:Skibidi Santa!

(They run.Santa runs after then with a gift box in his hand and points it towards Diamonde and out comes a mechanical hand and pushes Diamonde who falls flat on snow.)

Andromeda:Paraoh! Run before he gets you and fanum taxes you.WATCH OUT!

(Paraoh slips on snow and falls flat on his face.)

Andromeda:There he gets fanum taxed.Well I have a 93 percentage on my SLAPPING MA! Say goodbye!

(Andromeda slaps Santa but kicks her and knocks her out because he has 1400/100 in his Kicking MA.Santa runs back to kidnap Monica but a digital notification to let someone in appears in front of him and he gets knocked out by smashing his face accidentally on the yes button.)

Rigel:OK let's see Andromeda.Ouch! Ok come with me you have work to do. (Dragging Andromeda back.)
