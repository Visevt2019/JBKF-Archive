Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
Santa Claus is coming;
To kick Monica’s face.
Hey, jingle bells jingle bells, jingle all the way;
But Santa Claus got;
Kicked on his face.

Santa Claus was angry, he went home;
He returned and Monica;
Made him fall on his face.
Santa Claus was sad, he went home;
He never returned and;
Tied His magical shoe lace.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;

Then everyone kicked;
Monica out of her home.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
Monica went to Santa’s home
Then Santa jumped
From the roof on her face.

Monica was angry, she got up;
And gave two tight slaps on his face.
Santa Claus was red, he got up
And kidnapped Monica inside his home.
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;
From here the great story started!

Somewhere in the North Pole...

Paraoh:-Come on Monica, let's ask Santa about the Poem he meant about.

Monica:-Alright let's go...

Hark the heralds, the angels sing! tralalalalalalala. Glory to the new born king! tralalalalalalalala
Kick Paraoh in the face, Monica doesn't tie her lace. Hark the heralds, the angels sing! To Kick them all in the face!

Some fast-forward later..

Santa:-I can't tell you about the poem! That's classified!

Paraoh and Monica:-
Please...

Oh dear what a tragedy on November 26th. Monica didn't tie her shoe lace, Santa kicked her in the face.
Paraoh asked classified info
Santa kicked him with a Tango!

Paraoh:-Revenge is a must! How dare he even have the ability to do this to me!
The mech is almost made....
But I need a test subject.
Huh?!? What's this behind me?

On the other side while Paraoh discovers a portal...

Engineer Elfs:-We must upgrade Santa more! He will find the suit and destroy it!
The status of the flying rotator ships show no problem and the facekicker elves are ready to fight!
Even Mr.Reindeer is ready

Mr.Reindeer:-Yes I am !
I am the Reindeer Titan!

Some upgrading of Santa later...

Santa:-Let's find that suit, open the portal!
[Santa looked inside and saw...Parin won't let me tell as that would be an additional character so...]
Santa:-Nevermind...
Dispatch the facekicker elves, the rotators and the
flying sleighs!

The Face armored robots arrive and they begin to defeat the facekicker elves due to facial protection. The Reindeer Titan is severely damaged due to the fight with Monica as he could not stop her sound waves.
While retreating, Paraoh upgrades Charlie into a Mech and Charlie catches up to a fleeing Reindeer Titan.

Reindeer Titan:-Noo, leave me!
Charlie:-Why did Santa kick them in the face?!?

Reindeer Titan:-It was written in the poem!

[Ben also arrives as he is also upgraded by Paraoh]

Ben:-Stop speaking lies or else my gun your heart!

Reindeer Titan:-Idk if it's not the poem what it is but the Elf base is at the North pole...[begins crying]

Ben:-Let's go!

Meanwhile at the Paraoh base

Paraoh:-Unleash the Intercontinental Ballistic Holming Flat Face Nuke to the North pole!

Charlie:-We are here, Santa it's time!

Santa:-Child I have also been upgraded and I will...What's that?!?!

Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Santa Claus used to kick Monica's face,
Hard shoes!
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Now for S S Sake of the poem,
Santa Claus now decided to do this with,
Secret, orange, sponge, soft shoes.
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
But still didn't help much. 
The tradition of kicking face was still continuing. It was since 2 years. But as the faces were harmed, Santa decided to do by his special soft shoes. Just for sake of the poem. Still it didn't help much. 
          
Santa: hey Monica and her friends see kicking face has to be done, as your faces could be harmed, let's do this with my special soft shoes. 
          
Charlie: but why to kick face in the first place?
          
Diamonde: how many times you are asking this question. 
          
Ben: oh Charlie, remember that he told that he does for the poem. 
          
Paraoh: why is written in poem?
          
Santa: because I do. 
          
Charlie: why you do?
          
Santa: is written in poem. 

Paraoh: why it's written in poem?
          
Ben: oh come on Paraoh!
          
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way,
Santa Claus is coming to beautify Monica's face, 
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way, 
Really? Beautify face?
B B but Santa has to kick face, 
How could he just beautify face, 
Hey jingle bell jingle all the way, 
Hmm... something has to be done.

At Night 1 am
Santa:-Who is there?
Paraoh:-Its me.. [points gun]
Santa:-HEY CHILL!
Paraoh:-Tell me about the poem now.
Santa:-Okay okay fine.
So like I hear voices in my head and like uhhh these voices they tell me to do things and if I refuse to do it they force me to do it coincidentally...
Paraoh:-So there is a higher power involved in this?
Paraoh [Hypnotised by the power]:-You weren't supposed to tell that..
Santa:-So we finally meet...
Santa kicks Paraoh but the Power uses the old suit of Paraoh and shoots Santa with its railgun twice and Paraoh gets memory wiped

Paraoh:-What happened?
Santa:-Just go to sleep...
Paraoh:-I just remember a Sodium explosion....
Alright....

The Next morning
Paraoh:-Introducing to you all the face repair machine.

Santa:-Thats great.

They all use it to repair their distorted faces
Santa:-So there is a power above all and it controls us.
Nobody got controlled?

Ben:-You can't betray us
Paraoh:-Oh and I'm also taking my robotic army...
Monica:-Has he gone mad?
Santa: I have no idea
[Meanwhile]
Paraoh:-Comrades, I need you to kick them out of our base.
Robotic Army:-Let's go!

[They kick them out]
Paraoh:-Comrades, our planes will attack through the border after the U238 beam is equipped with a neutron laser and then it will turn into a Plutonium 238 beam exposing the invisible outer field.
[Everything goes according to plan]
Paraoh:-So here we are above the border.

Santa Claus is coming to kick, hit, punch, slap, disfigure, remove, beautify, Monica’s face
Hey jingle bell jingle bell jingle many ways
But Santa Claus got kicked in, on, above, inside, outside, behind, front, below, his face
Santa Claus got happy, sad, mad, bad, lonely, funny, angry
He went hospital, police station, airport, resort, restaurant, home
He returned and Monica made him fall, climb, fly, run, walk, swim, dive on his face
Santa Claus got sad
He went home
He never, always, sometimes, mostly, maybe returned and
Broke, cut, loosen, tight, ties his magical shoe lace

Since Santa hasn't

Against the law
That prohibits anyone
From kicking face.

And try it everywhere.
Then they just feel a normal,
Escape it everywhere.

Hey! Jingle bells jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Monica, Ben, Charlie, Diamonde, Paraoh,
Are coming to kick face,
Hey Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the weigh.

Finally they returned to universe to;
Start it all again.

When they find the origin,
of the original.
Then they start kick all again,

start kick face,
Tie shoe lace,
And create a supercalifragilisticexpialdocious mess.

Hey jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way.
Hey ho ho hocho hoho Santa go.
Hey Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way.

THE BISSEXTILE
Roses are red, violets are blue;
There's not a single day when,
People don't sue.
Apart from Autumn and Springs;
There's the beauty,
Where nature sings.

Corncockles are pink, 
Thimbleweeds are white;
Days never come without nights,
But there comes a little day,
Expecting to not come,
Without every year. 

There came the words;
Unique, idiosyncratic, special...
Accept, exempt, expect,
By the year, coming up, dividing;
4, not 100, or 400.

It's February 29th.
Happy leap year!!!


29.2.2024
1.3.2024
2.3.2024

Sent on 5.3.2024 because 29, 2+9=11.
1+1=2.
2 means February, but sent on March, so 3.
2+3=5
So sending date= 5.3.2024

Santa came at night,
With boots so tight,
He shouted loud,
And started a fight.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Kick face all the way,
Monica stood strong,
But Santa made her sway.

Ben held a badge,
Charlie held the time,
Paraoh built machines,
Diamode made them shine.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Slap face in the snow,
Santa tied his laces,
And shouted "Here we go!"

The fight went on,
Till morning light,
Cookies broke,
But faces were right.

Hey jingle bell, jingle bell,
Kick face all the way,
This is Hyphnyxys,
A brand-new play.

Santa Claus: Ho, ho, ho……. What’s up?

Monica: Mustn’t you be in your factory? Christmas is right here. 

Santa Claus: No cap! Yo young lady, that won’t work. Your attempts to ghost yourself and try to escape???

Monica: My goodness…..

(Scene 2)
Charlie: Come up with something fams?!

Paraoh: Dude, we found Santa’s office, his factory, but his home base???

Ben: Firstly, initiate any form of communication with Monica. Any phones, such devices she has?

Paraoh: I hope so. 

Diamonde: Hey guys, what’s the tea up to?

Charlie: Ways to reach Santa. 

Diamonde: See, for the initials, we’ve seen, how Santa has kicked, slapped etc. Monica’s face, that’s bizarre. 

Ben: Um..hm

Diamonde: That was the first part of the initials, we’ve reached the second I guess. Everything’s already planned. 

Paraoh: Fine. 

Diamonde: Just chill and vibe with water. 

(Scene 1)
Santa Claus: See, there’s a timeline we’re traveling in. There’s everything capped. 

Monica: Is the same traditional story lowkey you want???

Backdrop of previous session- as continuation of V1, Monica was kidnapped by Santa at his home base. Charlie, Ben, Paraoh, Diamonde were stressed out to find any way to reach Monica and save her. 


(Scene 1)
Diamonde: Damn! I’ve got an email from Santa! It’s some sort of coupon for any mid present at Santa’s store. 

Ben: Sis, there are also coordinates of his home base. 

Diamonde: Ah, seems like a scam. 

Ben: Halt, let me trace the coordinates. ( scraping the computer)
No cap! Dude the location is California! 

Charlie: You found the city too right?

Ben: Um Santa has sent this from a city called Santa Monica. 

Diamonde: That dude’s insane. 

Paraoh: Anyways, let’s go. 

(Scene 2)
(They all reach at Santa’s base)

Paraoh: Huh. An igloo?! In California?! That too with such a sign?!

( They spot an igloo with a neon sign “Santa’s-Not-Secret-Lair “)

Ben: That’s sus. 

Charlie: Subtle. A real subtle. 

Diamonde: At least there’s WiFi. 

Ben: Focus fam, there’s Monica inside. 

(Scene 3)
(They sneak in, but Santa’s traps are ridiculous)

Diamonde:(slips on a Candy cane) Aah, a hallway of candy canes that slip you off like banana peels. 

(They spot elves armed with nerf guns and a giant gingerbread man)

Ben: He’s crazy!

Charlie: This is less igloo on North Pole and more of ‘Willy Wonka with anger issues’

(Scene 4)
( They find Monica tied up with tinsel and Santa guarding her like WWE wrestler)

Santa: Ho Ho Ho. Hold up. Nobody leaves without a face-kick!

Ben: By the law of Christmas, release her!

Paraoh: (Deploys a malfunctioning snow bot that sprays whipped cream everywhere )

Charlie: Distract him!

Diamonde: (Throws the spam email printout at Santa) Here’s your coupon, Claus. 

Santa: (Slips on paper and face plants into the whipped cream) Hoooo!!!

Ben: Come on Monica! Run!

Monica: (Gets her hair tangled in Christmas lights) Ouch!

Paraoh: Oh dear.

(Scene 1)
Ben: Till Monica’s hair get untangled, delay the Santa so that we get time!

Paraoh: (Deploys the malfunctioning snow bot again, but it attempts to cut Monica’s hair)

Monica: Hey no! Stop!

Paraoh: Get off her head snow bot! 

(Snow bot fails to obey and crushes one of the light bulb mistakenly)

Monica: (The Christmas lights catch fire) Aaaah! Help! Aaaaaaaaaaahh!!!

Santa: Fire? In my igloo? This is ridiculous. You’ll be prosecuted for……

(Fire extinguishing system starts to spray kerosene)

Charlie: Stop the silly fire extinguishers! Dumb Santa!

Santa: You mean smart? That is to spread the fire….

Charlie: Spread! Your stupidity!

Santa: Bro, let me explain. You see as the fire spreads, the igloo melts. As the igloo melts, it drops ice on fire. And in turn that extinguishes it!

Charlie: I’ve no words….

Paraoh: Someone help Monica!

Monica: Aaaah! My hairs are burning! (Ice falls and punches her hair) Ouch!

Paraoh: Oh poor Monica! We’re so sorry, we’re helpless. 

(A few seconds later the fire goes off)

Monica: (Hairs completely burn and gets bald) No way! (Starts crying)

Santa: What now?

Diamonde: (throws spam email printouts again) Take it Santa!

Santa: (again face plants, but on the ash) Hoooo!

(The ash flies and drops over Monica)

Monica:(sneezes) Achooo!

Diamonde: Come on Monica! Run!

Monica: What’s happening? (Her hairs grow again) My hairs?

Paraoh: Aren’t those weird?

Ben: Her hairs grew again but fiber optic cables??? 

Monica: My hairs grew as fiber optic cables??!! OMG!

Santa: Woah! Who are you?!

Andromeda: Let me introduce myself, I am Andromeda Estefelwald, I have 93% in 5th year of MA in slapping face. I am here to….

Santa: That explains everything. Anyways, no foreign characters allowed!

Andromeda: Nah, I’m temporary, I’ll appear wherever needed. 

Santa: Hmmm. That’s fair, as you seem to have experience. 

Andromeda: Choo! (Tried something on Monica)

Monica: (hairs i.e. the fiber optic glow in rainbow colors) What’s happening?

Charlie: Well that’s pretty.

Andromeda: (disappears) Bye guys, Monica run! 

(The squad runs out the igloo) 

(Scene 2)
(They reach home) 

Monica: Oh... Finally!

Paraoh: Poor Monica! So much trouble comes up to you!

Andromeda: (Reappears) Yes dear, that's why I'm here.

Monica: Please turn my hair back to normal!

Andromeda: Sorry, not yet.

Ben: Anyways, thanks for the help.

Andromeda: (Disappears) No problem!

Diamonde: I think everything's normal.

Paraoh: Let's just forget about what had happened.

Ben: Yeah, let's go for an evening walk on the promenade.

Charlie: Okay, just chill and have some peaceful and leisurely time now, after all that struggle.

        <h3>Usual Paradox</h3>
        <div class="poem">
Hx 6
By Parin
30 October 2025
          
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;  
Santa Claus is written;  
To kick Monica’s face.  
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way;  
Because the line exists;  
Santa finds the place.  

Santa Claus was typed, he slid in;  
The stanza said “kick,”  
So Santa learned the pace.  
Santa Claus did kick, he kicked;  
The poem stated it;  
And therefore set the pace.  

Charlie, Ben and Paraoh ran;  
Diamonde clipped the beat;  
They queued a rescue trace.  
Monica dropped a clap, she logged;  
The chorus rewrote itself;  
But the line kept looping space.  

It is written: Santa kicks face;  
Because it’s written, he kicks;  
Because he kicks, the verse persists.  
Jingle spins, repeat the case;  
Text makes move, move makes text;  
They keep paradox on the fix.

Ben:Santa! What have you done! You began a loop!

Santa:Stop blaming me or else I will make you fanum tax my kicks.Cap! It wasn't me! It was your so called "poem"!

(Ben jumps to destroy the poem by tearing it but Santa fanum taxed his leg and pulls him back.)

Paraoh:What the sigma?

Monica:Santa opened a time loop.

(Santa kicks Monica's face.)

Santa:Fanum tax my kicks haha!

Charlie:How dare you? 
(Slaps Santa's face.)

Santa:That does it!

(Santa let's Ben go and jumps on Charlie's face.)

Paraoh and Diamonde:Skibidi Santa!

(They run.Santa runs after then with a gift box in his hand and points it towards Diamonde and out comes a mechanical hand and pushes Diamonde who falls flat on snow.)

Andromeda:Paraoh! Run before he gets you and fanum taxes you.WATCH OUT!

(Paraoh slips on snow and falls flat on his face.)

Andromeda:There he gets fanum taxed.Well I have a 93 percentage on my SLAPPING MA! Say goodbye!

(Andromeda slaps Santa but kicks her and knocks her out because he has 1400/100 in his Kicking MA.Santa runs back to kidnap Monica but a digital notification to let someone in appears in front of him and he gets knocked out by smashing his face accidentally on the yes button.)

Rigel:OK let's see Andromeda.Ouch! Ok come with me you have work to do. (Dragging Andromeda back.)

(The physicists were conducting harmonic motion experiments)
(Inverter- Assistant experimentalist
 Colian- Cryogenics specialist
 Jessica- Head of department)

Inverter: Alright, pendulum set at 77K. Also, all other arrangements are ready, floor magnetized, sensors….

Colian: Did you use appropriate amount of nitrogen? Remember, it won’t turn to superconductor.

Inverter: Ahhh..

Colian: You’ve refrigerated! Did you!?

Inverter: Happens dude… Sorry. 

Colian: Dude! The guests might arrive anytime!

Inverter: We can still prove our theory.

Colian: How? This non linear….

Inverter: What on Earth!

Santa: Ow! Where am I?

Inverter: Who are you sir / mam?

Santa: It’s me Santa! Your dear Santa Claus!

Colian: I don’t care! Didn’t you find entrance gate or didn’t the guards let you in that you broke in this way?!

Inverter: You dare break in our laboratory without any consent! You’ve destroyed our experiment!

Santa: I’m extremely sorry for this but…

Jessica: (Arrives hastily) Oh mine eyes! What calamity is this? Dost the guests stand at our door? Is the experiment in readiness?

Inverter: (Whispering) Ma’am, our experiments weren’t even ready.

Jessica: Shut up! I shall prosecute thee!

Santa: I’m sorr…

Colian: Sir, I apologize for your inconvenience, but you have to leave our lab even if you can’t, if possible try to revive things with your so called magical powers.

Jessica: O heavens! If the guests arrive, and what spectacle shall we lay before their eyes?

Scene 3
(Charlie, Monica, Paraoh, Diamonde, Monica are on their way to CERN laboratory)

Charlie: So what theory are they gonna flex on us?

Ben: Bruh, some kinda non‑linear chaos mixed with harmonic motion or whatever.

Diamonde: Wait, wasn’t there that Meissner thing too? Like the superconducting glowup?

Ben: Bruh, this guy's been all up in Monica's business since forever. 

Inverter: Even in ours! You see that destruction? That's done by him.

(Santa kicks Monica's face and throws her through the lab instruments) 

Inverter: Uhh... 

(Charlie and Diamonde jump in the fight and start kicking)
(Santa throws whatever comes to his hand)

Colian: Oh my! The instruments cost a fortune! 

Jessica: O nay nay nay! Desist forewith! I shall not brook further ruination! (Jumps in the fight to stop them but gets her face hit by pendulum)

Ben: (Whispering) Dude, why does the lady speak such old fashioned English?

(The squad secretly tries to escape, sneaking behind entanglement engine)
(They get exposed and the entanglement engine activates)

Lilputianaleviastin: Oh wait wait wait! Please wait! No!

Scene 1
(The squad gets entangled with random objects in room.)

Ben: I feel the vibe of the stapler.

Diamonde: No cap! This book's gigachad! 

Charlie: Bruh, I’m literally linked to a cloth. 

Lilputianaleviastin: Oh fellows! What have you done!?

Jessica: O calamity! The entanglement hath bound thee to the trivialities!

Asspharagus: (panicking) sir, the entanglement engine is not supposed to do this!

Lilputianaleviastin: (Furious) You fools! You have triggered the entanglement cycle!

(The machine pulses and they flicker in and out the existence)

Paraoh: Bruh I’m sitting and standing, this is illegal physics. 

Charlie: I’m literally in multiverse mode. I just saw myself in another timeline. 

(Santa is ‘ho ho ho’ing and crying at the same time)

Jessica: lo! The paradox hath doubled thy souls.

(Suddenly harmonic tones start echoing, walls get strange music)

Santa: Uh, I th

Monica: ink tha

Santa: t my pho

Monica: nes music

Santa: got stuck

Monica: in it. 

Jessica: O what a folly! Thy music hath got in superposition with thee!

Asspharagus: Wait! It’s processing something!

Lilputianaleviastin: (Eyes widening)  The quantum Carol!

Diamonde: Bruh, it’s literally singing math. 

Ben: physics karaoke unlocked!

Santa: come on guys! Let’s harmonize before this blows off!

(The squad tries to sing but their voices clash horribly)

Monica: Bruh, we sound like broken Wi-Fi. 

Diamonde: no cap! The machine’s cringing. 

Jessica: Align thy pitch! Harmonize thy souls! Else the Carol shall unmaketh thee!

(The Carol goes louder)
(The entangled squad sees equations swirl in air like holograms, half, full, wave formed)
(The physicists stare in awe as the Carol takes shape)

Lilputianaleviastin: (Terrified) If they fail, the Carol will collapse the entire department. 

Asspharagus: Then we’re all quantum soup. 

(Jessica raises her arms like conducting a Shakespearean maestro)
(Santa gives ‘ho ho ho’ music)
(The squad adds Gen Z harmonies)
(The scientists chant equations in rhythm)

Santa: Ho ho hooooooo….

Ben & Charlie: Bruh uh uh uh……

Diamonde: No cappppppp…..

Jessica: Sing, ye mortals. Let the paradox yeild to harmony. 

Lilputianaleviastin & Asspharagus & Inverter & Colian: (chanting) psi equals alpha, psi equals beta….

(After some time of chaos)
(The squad gets teleported to random corners of the room)

Jessica: lo! The Quantum Carol is complete!

Santa: Ho, ho ho! We did it!

Ben: Bruh, we just saved physics with karaoke. 

Diamonde: No cap! We’re legends. 

Charlie: This is the Kickmus anthem.

        <div class="poem">
Ks 5
By Parin
22 December 2025

Paraoh: Hmm… okay.
          
(The Entanglement Engine hums louder, reacting to Jessica. Scientists glance nervously at the readings. The hum grows into a low chant, almost like the Carol repeating itself.)

Lilputianaleviastin: Strange… the resonance signature doesn’t match the rest of you.
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, it’s like there’s a timeline bug in the system.
          
(Jessica stiffens, her eyes darting. She tries to laugh it off, but her voice trembles.)
          
Jessica: With my fellow Galileo, for a thousand years have I guarded this Carol…
          
(The squad freezes. Silence. Then chaos.)
          
Ben: Bruh, did she just say a thousand years?
          
Diamonde: No cap… Jessica’s sus.
          
Charlie: Bro, Galileo’s been gone for centuries. How do you know him?
          
Santa: Ho ho ho… unless you were there!
          
(Jessica fumbles, clutching her robe. A pendant slips out and clatters to the floor. Charlie picks it up, holding it high.)
          
Charlie: Bro, this thing’s older than Santa’s beard.
          
Diamonde: No cap, it looks medieval.
          
Lilputianaleviastin: (scanning) Impossible… her quantum imprint appears across centuries.
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, she’s literally a timeline bug!
          
(Jessica backs away, her Shakespearean tone breaking into desperation.)
          
Jessica: Nay! Ye misjudge me!
(The Entanglement Engine suddenly surges, pulling Jessica into superposition flickers. Her body shifts rapidly — a young maiden, a middle‑aged scholar, an ancient crone. The squad gasps.)

Santa: Ho ho ho! She’s literally time‑lagging!
          
Ben: Bruh, she’s glitching like bad Wi‑Fi.
          
Diamonde: No cap, she’s older than the whole syllabus.
          
Jessica: O cruel fate! My disguise undone! Forsooth, I am bound by centuries, cursed to wander through paradox and guard the Carol!
          
(The squad gathers, whispering like an Among Us vote. The scientists watch, horrified but powerless.)
          
Paraoh: No cap! There's and Imposter Among Us!
          
Diamonde: Bruh, she’s the imposter.
          
Charlie: No cap, eject her!
          
Ben: Bruh, lab rules, eject the sus.
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! To the engine with her!
          
(Jessica pleads, her voice echoing with Shakespearean grandeur.)
          
Jessica: Stay thy hand! I am guardian, not foe! The Carol is mine to protect!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: (shaking head) Guardian or not, you are a paradox, just like that of JBKF.
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, she’s destabilizing the whole lab.
          
(The squad pushes Jessica toward the Entanglement Engine. The machine roars, swallowing her in a flash of resonance. Her body dissolves into light, scattering across timelines.)

Jessica: I shall return, when paradox calls again!
          
(She vanishes. Only echoes of her Shakespearean voice linger in the lab, reverberating like ghostly verses. The scientists stare in awe, trembling.)

Monica: (sobbing) Is she dead?
          
Lilputianaleviastin: She’s not gone, she’s scattered across her centuries.
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, she’s literally in her own timeline now.
          
(The squad looks at each other, shaken but triumphant. The Entanglement Engine hums ominously, its coils glowing faintly, hinting that Jessica’s paradox may not be over. The Carol’s resonance lingers, whispering of future chaos.)

Santa: Ho ho ho… lads, this isn’t the end.
          
Diamonde: No cap… she’s coming back.
          
Charlie: Bro, next time she returns, we better be ready.

Ben: Oh guys, but hey! Today was the end Hanukkah!

Santa: So?

Ben: Jessica couldn't put the last candle.

Santa: Oh man, let it be.

Ben: No we can't! We'll be cursed by her!

        <h3>Frosty Formula</h3>
        <div class="poem">
Ks 6
By Parin
23 December 2025

(The Entanglement Engine quiets after Jessica’s ejection. Her Shakespearean echo fades. The lab is silent, but the air grows colder. Frost creeps across the walls, pipes, and shattered glass. The collapsed quantum computer hums faintly, releasing waves of icy resonance.)

Lilputianaleviastin: The collapse… it’s cooling everything!
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, quantum physics always needed cool situations, but this is insane.
          
(Equations on the greenboard shimmer, freezing into icy letters. Snowflakes swirl around them. The chalk glows faintly, writing itself.)
          
Diamonde: No cap… the whole department’s turning into frost.
          
Ben: Bruh, seems like Jessica's curse, her last candle could have given enough warmth.
          
Santa: Ho ho ho… lads, behold! A new paradox emerges!
          
(On the greenboard, glowing frost writes itself: Force = Mass × Kickmus Acceleration.)
          
Charlie: Bro, that’s Newton’s law but frosty.
          
Paraoh: Hmm… okay.
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! The Frosty Formula!
          
(Santa grabs chalk, scribbling furiously. He adds: Torque = Force × Face Radius.)
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! Now, the torque of a face kick… multiplied by festive cheer!
          
Monica: Bruh, you’re calculating face kicks?
          
Diamonde: No cap, this is gonna end badly.
          
(Santa straps sensors to the squad’s heads. Equations swirl holographically above the greenboard. Predictions appear: “Beautification Level: 100%.”)

Santa: Ho ho ho! The math predicts beautification! Your faces shall glow like ornaments!
          
Jessica:(Echoes from the timelines) Beware… equations deceive…
          
(The squad kicks. The sleigh shakes. Torque transfers. Instead of beautification, faces distort comically — noses bent, cheeks stretched, hair blown back.)
          
Ben: Bruh, I look like a Picasso painting.
          
Diamonde: No cap, my jaw’s in another dimension.
          
Charlie: Bro, the math lied.
          
Santa: Ho ho ho… impossible! The Frosty Formula cannot fail!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: (scribbling notes) The formula predicted beautification, but experiments destroy instead.
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, it’s literally inverse physics.

(The greenboard equations flicker, rewriting themselves: Force = Mass × Kickmus Chaos.)
(The lab trembles. Frost deepens. Equations peel off the blackboard, turning into icy shards that fly across the room.)
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! Lads, brace yourselves… the Frosty Formula has gone rogue!
          
(Snow whirls into a blizzard inside the lab. The squad shields their faces as equations manifest into icy creatures — fractal snowmen made of formulas, marching forward.)

Ben: Bruh, the math’s alive!
          
Diamonde: No cap, we’re fighting algebra snowmen.
          
Charlie: Bro, this is the final exam from hell.
          
Jessica:(Distant echo) Lo! The formula is cursed… Kickmus acceleration breeds destruction, not beauty!
          
(The squad prepares to battle the rogue Frosty Formula, equations swirling like icy monsters)

        <h3>Kickmus Reactor</h3>
        <div class="poem">
Ks 7
By Parin
25 December 2025

(The Frosty Formula collapses. Equations explode into icy shards)
(A blinding flash engulfs the squad)
(When the light fades, they’re inside a sprawling nuclear power plant — humming turbines, control panels, radiation warning signs. The air is heavy, metallic, vibrating with tension)

Ben: Bruh… we just got teleported.
          
Diamonde: No cap, this s an actual reactor.
          
Charlie: Bruh, these bells look like Christmas decorations.

Ben: Oh yeah right. It’s Christmas, it’s 25.
          
Santa: Ho ho ho… lads, behold!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: Oh dear! I guess the Entanglement Engine got too cold.
          
(Suddenly, metallic bells ring out — reactor sirens. Their deep clang echoes through the chamber, signaling anomaly detection. Engineers in hazmat suits rush in, panicked)

Engineer: Sirens triggered! Radiation flux anomaly detected!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: The bells aren’t ornaments… they’re tied to the reactor’s safety system.

Asspharagus: Bruh, Santa’s touch just activated them.
          
(Santa slams his hand onto a console. The sirens ring louder, vibrating the entire chamber. Radiation waves ripple outward, distorting the squad’s faces — expanding, compressing, stretching like rubber masks)

Ben: Bruh, my face just stretched into widescreen.
          
Diamonde: No cap, I look like a funhouse mirror.
          
(Suddenly, one massive siren bell, mounted above the reactor chamber, breaks loose. It crashes down into the uranium containment chamber with a deafening clang)
(The impact resonates through the core, triggering a chain reaction. The uranium begins to glow, unstable, pulsing like a heartbeat. Radiation spikes.)
          
Engineer: The bell collapsed into the chamber! The uranium is reacting! (screams) Run away!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: The resonan#56ce is amplifying the fission waves… this is catastrophic!
          
Asspharagus: Bruh, the bell turned the reactor into a paradox amplifier!
          
(The uranium glow intensifies, beams of greenight hooting uward. The sirens keep ringing, each clang destabilizing the reactor further)
(The squad shields their eyes as the chamber shakes violently)
(The reactor begins to mel down. Seamursts from pipes. Radiation waves distort the squad’s faces grotesquely — cheeks balloon, jaws shrink, eyes stretch sideways. The ground trembles)
(Engineers flee)
(The squad is left alone with Santa and Quantum Physicists)
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! Lads, this isno rdinary shutdown… this is Kickmus chaos incarnate!
          
Charlie: Bro, if this thing blows, we’re toast.
          
Diamonde: No cap, this is bigger than the Frosty Formula.
          
Santa: (pulls out a battered manual. Pages flutter) Ho ho ho…  (pointing to one line: “Shutdown Protocol = synchronized face kick.”) Only one way to stabilize it… synchronized face kick!

(The squad hesitates. Radiation waves distort their bodies)
(The uranium glow pulses faster, threatening to breach containment)
          
Santa: (raises hand like a conductor) Ho ho ho! On my count… three, two, one… Kick!
          
(They deliver a synchronized face kick)
(The impact reverberates through the chamber, resonating with the sirens)
(The uranium glow flickers, then surges violently. Radiations level increase)
(The chamber blasts violently blinding everyone)
          
Asspharagus: Aaah! No!
          
Santa: Ho ho ho! Shit down incomplete! The Kickmus Reactor is not safe…
          
(They get teleported back to the Quantum Physics Department)
          
Lilputianaleviastin: (Enraged) My gosh! No way! Guys! You’ve ruined our Entanglement Engine!
          
Asspharagus: Yeah! It has to be thrown off, elsitwill malfunction the same way!
          
Lilputianaleviastin: Exactly! Same with the Quantum Computer!
          
Asspharagus: You’re fond of kkcking right? Go on and kick the Entanglement Engine and destroy it!
          
(They all kick the Entanglement Engine)
(The Entanglement Engine breaks down and performs the last malfunction – The squad along with Santa get teleported in Santa’s sleigh)
(The Physicists stare at the sleigh as it backs and approaches them with great velocity)
